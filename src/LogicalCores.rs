/// Logical cores to use for process and thread affinity, abstracting away platform, library and Operating System differences.
///
/// Provides the following definitions:-
///
/// * Constant `LogicalCores::IsSettingProcessAffinitySupported`: Boolean that is true if the current platform contains a way to attempt to set process affinity.
/// * Constant `LogicalCores::IsSettingThreadAffinitySupported`: Boolean that is true if the current platform contains a way to attempt to set thread affinity. Note that this is true for Fuschia and Empscripten, but that setting thread affinity always fails as unsupported as of 3rd December 2018.
///
/// * Method `set_current_process_affinity(&self) -> io::Result<()>`: Tries to set the current process' affinity; may fail (eg may not be supported in particular revisions of an OS, particularly so on Fuschia and Emscripten).
/// * Method `set_process_affinity(&self, process_identifier) -> io::Result<()>`: As above, but for a particular process. Usually fails with permission denied if not root.
/// * Method `set_current_thread_affinity(&self) -> io::Result<()>`: Tries to set the thread process' affinity; may fail (eg may not be supported in particular revisions of an OS, particularly so on Fuschia and Emscripten).
/// * Method `set_thread_affinity(&self, thread_identifier) -> io::Result<()>`: As above, but for a thread process. Usually fails with permission denied if not root.
///
/// If support for a platform has not been explicitly added to this library then it will not fail on that platform but it will not change any process or thread affinities, either.
///
/// At this time, there is no support for Solaris.
/// If you're interested in adding support, see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14085515/obtain-lwp-id-from-a-pthread-t-on-solaris-to-use-with-processor-bind>.
///
/// DragonFlyBSD and FreeBSD currently (as of 3rd December 2018) support 256 cores.
///
/// Windows is a bit squiffy with more than 64 cores.
///
/// Create using one of the `From` implementations.
///
/// Sadly, actually getting a list of the cores the current process can use is quite tricky; a little more Linux specific information can be obtained using the `dpdk-unix` crate's `HyperThread` struct and the `libnuma-sys` crate's static field `numa_all_cpus_ptr`, which is derived from the parsing of the line starting `Cpus_allowed:` in `/proc/self/status` and capping it with the maximum CPUs in the system. Yuck!
